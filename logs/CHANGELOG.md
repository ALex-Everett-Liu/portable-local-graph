## [0.5.5] - 2025-08-21

### üéØ Save As Timestamp Preservation - Complete Fix
- **Unified Save Behavior**: Save and Save As now behave identically for timestamp handling
- **Database File Copying**: Save As operations now copy source database files instead of recreating
- **Complete Timestamp Preservation**: All `created_at` and `modified_at` fields preserved during Save As
- **Zero Data Loss**: Original database untouched during Save As operations
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Both Electron and Web modes use identical copy+update workflow

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **File Copy Strategy**: `fs.copyFileSync()` used to duplicate database files with all data intact
- **UPSERT Update**: After copying, UPSERT logic updates only changed records while preserving timestamps
- **Source Database Detection**: Automatically detects current database path for accurate copying
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback to new database creation if source unavailable
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Enhanced debugging for Save As operations

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Operations
- **Copy-Then-Update**: New Save As workflow = copy database + UPSERT current data
- **Timestamp Integrity**: No timestamp destruction during file operations
- **Atomic Operations**: Each step logged and verified for data consistency
- **Path Management**: Proper handling of source and target file paths

## [0.5.4] - 2025-08-21

- **Safe SQL Construction**: Dynamic parameter binding based on record existence
- **Local Time Injection**: All INSERT/UPDATE operations use local system time
